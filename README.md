# Raycast-Engine
Simple Project attempting to create a 3d environment using the ray casting method used in games like Wolfenstein3D

<p> // Write a basic premis of the raycaster here </p>

## TODO:
[x] Add lighting, farther lines are darker.<br>
- Adds color to a texture strip depending on the distance of the ray and the light level<br>

[] Add floor & ceiling.<br>

[x] Add texturing to the walls.<br>
- When a ray hits a wall, I detect what percentage of the wall hit, I use that percentage to know where to start on the texture, then I draw the texture starting at that point to RES points next<br>

[] Add entity that'll follow you.<br>
[] Add object you can interact with<br>
[] Add a gun<br>
