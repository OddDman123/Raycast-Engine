# Raycast-Engine
Simple Project attempting to create a 3d environment using the ray casting method used in games like Wolfenstein3D

<p> // Write a basic premis of the raycaster here </p>

## TODO:
- [] Add lighting, farther lines are darker.
- [] Add floor & ceiling.
- [x] Add texturing to the walls.
<p>When a ray hits a wall, I detect what percentage of the wall hit, I use that percentage to know where to start on the texture, then I draw the texture starting at that point to RES points next</p>
<br> [] Add entity that'll follow you.
<br> [] Add object you can interact wit.h
<br> [] Add a gun
